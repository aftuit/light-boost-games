        version was re-released by Sold-Out Software in 2002.
        Although Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is not the first RTS game to have         
        offered multiplayer gameplay, it persuaded a wider audience that 
        multiplayer capabilities were essential for future RTS games. The 
        game introduced innovations in its mission design and gameplay elements, 
        which were adopted by other RTS developers. Warcraft games emphasize skillful 
        management of relatively small         
        forces, and they maintain characters and storylines within a cohesive 
        fictional universe. Sales were fairly high, reviewers were mostly impressed, and 
        the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others. The game's sequel, 
        Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, became the main rival to Command & Conquer series by
         Westwood Studios. This competition fostered an "RTS boom" in the midâ€“ to late 1990s.`

        conceived in late 1996, when Blizzard's sister company Capitol

        the CD-i games from The Legend of Zelda series. While the game design and

        Magic handled the programming and art respectively in Boston and Saint Petersburg`
